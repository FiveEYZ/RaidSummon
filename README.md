# RaidSummon

## How it works:
You are in a RAID group  
Someone types 123, sum or summon as the first letters in /ra or /s or /y  
Playername gets added to the small RaidSummon frame and is synced accros all RaidSummon users  
SHIFT + leftclick to move the frame  
If a player is on the list the frame is visible (type /rs to show/hide it manually)  
Left click to summon and remove (synced)  
Control Left click to just target the player  
Right click to remove (synced)  

If no player is on the list the frame is hidden again (type /rs to show/hide it manually)  

Options:  
/rs help  
/rs zone(enabled/disables zoneinfo in /w and /ra)  
/rs whispers (enabled/disables whispering the target)  


## 1.1.0 Updates:
Class Colors are now used in the List  
Warlocks are always on top of the list
